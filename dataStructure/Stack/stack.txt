         Stack is data structure is a sequential collection of element that follows the principle LIFO(Last In First Out);
         Stack is abstract data type
         Last element Inserted in remove that element first in Stack 


         Stack Data Structure Support two main operations

           push() 
           pop()
           
           stack implement linear complexity in array add & remove element in any position but in stack follows LIFO principle
           list with restriction then you cn go with stack
